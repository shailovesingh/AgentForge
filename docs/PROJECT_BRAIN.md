# PROJECT BRAIN — AGENTFORGE

> This is the canonical shared engineering memory for AgentForge.
> Keep it synchronized with the actual repository state.
> Do not confuse planned functionality with implemented functionality.

## 1. Project Identity

- **Name:** AgentForge
- **Product:** Visual AI Agent Builder
- **Status:** Architecture approved (D-001 to D-011). Phase 1 (visual builder) **implemented and verified; under final acceptance review** (ChatGPT review positive; PO acceptance pending). Workflow contract **pending final code review** (D-013). **Phase 2 is proposed only, not approved**; no backend exists.
- **Product Owner:** User
- **Principal Architect:** ChatGPT
- **Implementation Engineer:** Claude Code

## 2. Product Vision

Build a platform that allows users to create AI agents and automation workflows through:

1. Visual drag-and-drop editing.
2. Natural-language workflow generation.
3. Conversational workflow modification.
4. Autonomous AI agent execution.
5. MCP and external integrations.
6. Workflow monitoring and debugging.

## 3. Approved Technology Choices

Record changes in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Versions actually installed in `frontend/` (resolved by npm on 2026-11-03):** React 19.3, Vite 8.3, TypeScript 7.0, Vitest 5.1, @xyflow/react 12.12, zustand 5.0, lucide-react 1.66, oxlint 1.x. See Known Issue 8.

## 4. Core Architecture

Full description: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Summary:

- **Frontend:** visual canvas, node library, config panel, editor store. Implemented in Phase 1.
- **Backend:** API layer, workflow manager, validation, node catalog/registry, DAG execution engine, agent runtime, integrations. **Not started.**
- **AI layer:** workflow generation, NL editing, LLM node, agent node, memory, tool calling. **Not started.**

## 5. Architecture Rules

- Workflow JSON is the canonical workflow definition.
- Node catalog is the source of truth for available nodes.
- Every node has defined input/output contracts.
- The workflow engine is independent of LangGraph and is a dependency-based DAG executor with conditional branching, skipped nodes and concurrency-capable design (D-006, as clarified by the PO).
- LangGraph manages autonomous agent behavior inside the Agent node.
- AI-generated graphs must pass validation.
- External actions must respect authorization and approval.
- Secrets must not be included in LLM prompts or workflow exports.

## 6. Actual Repository Status

*Last updated 2026-11-03 (Session 2).*

### Git

Branch `main`. Commits:

| Commit | Content |
|---|---|
| `798ab84` | Initial commit: documentation and Claude rules |
| `2466b26` | Phase 1 step 1: scaffold frontend |
| `5af36e5` | Phase 1 steps 2–3: Workflow v1 types, catalog, store |
| `35fe3bc` | Phase 1 steps 4–9: canvas, library, config panel, connection rules, import/export |

Latest commit: **`5c89203`** (documentation sync). **There is no Git remote and nothing has been pushed to GitHub**; all work exists only in this local repository.

**Uncommitted working-tree changes (as of Session 3, deliberately not committed until the PO approves):** `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-012 to D-018), `docs/PROJECT_BRAIN.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, and the new `docs/PHASE1_REVIEW.md` and `docs/PHASE2_PLAN.md`. No application code is modified (`git diff HEAD -- frontend` is empty).

## 7. Current Development State

- **Current phase:** Phase 1 — implementation complete; under final acceptance review. Phase 1.1 and Phase 2 are **proposed only**.
- **Last completed task:** Session 3 (review documentation, uncommitted); before that Session 2, Phase 1 steps 0–10.
- **Last code commit:** `35fe3bc`.

### Verification results (actual, run 2026-11-03)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx tsc -b` (strict) | exit 0 |
| `npm run lint` (oxlint) | exit 0, no warnings |
| `npm test` (Vitest) | **6 files, 48 tests, all passed** |
| `npm run build` | exit 0 (JS 431 kB / 137 kB gzip) |
| Browser run, Chrome headless, Playwright script | **44 / 44 checks passed** |

**Unit tests cover:** catalog consistency (unique types, unique port names, defaults satisfy schema); config validation and input parsing; every store action; every connection rule including transitive cycles; export -> import -> export byte-identical; migration chain; rejection of malformed JSON, wrong version, unknown node types, bad configs, duplicate ids, bad ports, type mismatch and cycles; library search; icon registry.

**Browser run covered (Chrome only):** library list, search and empty state; drag-and-drop landing at the cursor; click and Enter-key add; Delete/Backspace on nodes and edges; valid connections; rejection of occupied-input, duplicate and type-mismatched connections; config panel editing, label edit, invalid number and invalid JSON flagged and **not committed**; export contents (no React Flow fields, edited config present, name-derived filename); import into a fresh page; byte-identical re-export; failed imports leaving the graph untouched; node drag persisting position; deleting a node removing its edges; "New" clearing the canvas; no console errors.

**The browser script is not in the repository.** It ran from a scratch directory with `playwright-core` and the locally installed Chrome. It is therefore not reproducible from the repo, and repo-based E2E remains deferred (open question 2).

**Re-run in Session 3 (code unchanged vs `HEAD`):** `npx tsc -b` exit 0; `npm run lint` exit 0; `npm test` 6 files / 48 tests passed; `npm run build` exit 0.

**Follow-up browser run (second ad hoc script, Chrome, 8/8 checks):** cycle rejection (llm2 -> llm1 creates no edge); handle feedback while dragging (occupied input shows the danger colour, a valid free input shows the ok colour, releasing on it creates the edge); pan and wheel zoom change the viewport; dark colour scheme applies and was inspected in a screenshot (legible).

**Not tested:** Firefox, Safari, Edge; screen-reader behavior; keyboard-only canvas operation (moving or connecting nodes without a mouse); large graphs; touch devices.

## 8. Technical Decisions

Full log: `docs/DECISIONS.md`. **D-001 to D-012 are Approved.** Session 3 review decisions (recorded but uncommitted): D-012 keep TypeScript 7 / Vite 8 / Oxlint / Vitest 5 (Approved); **D-013 Workflow JSON v1 and catalog architecture: Pending final code review**; D-014 providers Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (Approved, catalog not yet updated); D-015 provider-neutral adapter (Approved, not implemented); D-016 no credentials in workflow JSON (Approved, holds today); D-017 non-blocking editor warnings (Approved, not implemented); D-018 errors separate from warnings (Approved, not implemented). D-006 carries the PO clarification (dependency-based DAG executor with branching, skipping and concurrency-capable design; cycles rejected in v1; LangGraph handles loops inside the Agent node).

Small implementation choices made in Session 2 without a decision entry (flagged for architect review):
- Followed Vite template defaults: **oxlint** instead of ESLint, **TypeScript 7**, Vite 8, Vitest 5.
- `strict: true` enabled in `tsconfig.app.json` (the template lacked it).
- Workflow JSON v1 omits `credentialRef` config fields for now; they arrive with credential management.
- Connection rules live in one pure function (`workflow/connections.ts`) reused by the canvas, the store and the importer.
- `fitView` runs only after an import; on mount it zoomed into the first node added.

## 9. Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Unrelated parent instructions file.** `C:\Users\shail\Downloads\CLAUDE.md` is the spec for a different project (AI Hiring MVP: Streamlit/FAISS/Whisper). Claude Code loads it into every AgentForge session and it conflicts with this stack. **Action for PO:** move it out of the AgentForge parent path. Claude does not modify files outside this repo.
2. **No persistence.** Reloading the page loses the in-editor workflow (by design; persistence is Phase 2). Export/import is the only way to keep work.
3. **No undo/redo.**
4. **Browser coverage is Chrome only**; see "Not tested" in §7.
5. **Provider list is a placeholder.** The LLM and Agent nodes offer `ollama | openai | anthropic`, pending open question 1.
6. **The importer does not enforce "required inputs connected" or non-empty required strings** (e.g. an empty HTTP URL is accepted). ARCHITECTURE §4 lists these as validator rules; they belong to run-time validation in Phase 3, since an editor must be able to hold incomplete graphs.
7. **The workflow `description` and `metadata` are preserved on import/export but have no UI.**
8. **Toolchain versions are newer than typical** (TypeScript 7, Vite 8, oxlint). They work, but the architect should confirm they are acceptable; falling back to ESLint is possible.
9. **Windows encoding incident (fixed):** early in Session 2, PowerShell 5.1 `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` added UTF-8 BOMs and re-encoded non-ASCII characters in `docs/PROJECT_BRAIN.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md` (e.g. `§` became `Â§`). Both were repaired and verified by scanning all docs for mojibake. These two files were committed with the damage in `798ab84`; the repair is in the documentation commit.
10. **Edge stroke is low-contrast in dark mode** (cosmetic; React Flow default colours).
11. Node ids are 8-character random strings; collision risk is negligible at editor scale but unchecked.
12. **No GitHub remote.** The repository is local only; there is no off-machine backup and CI cannot run until a remote exists.
13. **HTTP Request `headers` is free-form JSON** and could hold a pasted secret; only its description warns against this (D-016). No technical guard yet.
14. **Workflow contract concerns for Phase 2** (5 high, 9 medium, 7 low) are listed in `docs/PHASE1_REVIEW.md` §1.4. The high ones (H1 config schema is a hand-rolled subset, H2 rules exist only in TypeScript, H3 no `typeVersion` migration, H4 branching not expressible, H5 JSONB key order vs byte-identical export) need decisions before the Pydantic models are written.
15. The provider enum lacks `groq` (D-014); it is not changed during the review because the contract is frozen.

## 10. Open Questions

The six questions below are the original §10 questions. Full answers and reasoning: `docs/PHASE1_REVIEW.md` §2. **Settled** = decided by the PO's 2026-11-03 review message. **Proposed** = my recommendation, awaiting PO confirmation.

| # | Question | Status | Answer (summary) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LLM providers.** Which are first-class in Phase 4? | **Settled** (D-014) | Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama. Catalog enum needs `groq` (additive, not yet done). |
| 2 | **Repo-based E2E tests.** Add Playwright as a dev dependency now, or defer until after Phase 2? | Proposed | Approve now as a small Phase 1.1 task before Phase 2 step 10. Needs a GitHub remote for CI. |
| 3 | **Toolchain.** Accept TypeScript 7 / Vite 8 / oxlint, or switch to ESLint? | **Settled** (D-012) | Keep; no ESLint. |
| 4 | **Phase 1 acceptance.** Does the PO / architect accept Phase 1 as complete? | Proposed | Accept as functionally complete and verified, with two tracked conditions: D-013 final contract code review (blocks Phase 2 step 2) and a Phase 1.1 follow-up (groq, warnings, Playwright). Phase 2 is not approved by this. |
| 5 | **Auth.** Is multi-user auth a hard requirement before any deployment, or is single-user local mode acceptable until Phase 7? | Proposed | Single-user local mode until Phase 7, but include `users` and `owner_id` from the first migration with one `get_current_user()` seam; never expose beyond localhost without auth. |
| 6 | **Editor-side validation UX.** Should the editor show non-blocking warnings before Phase 3, or wait for the engine's validator? | **Settled in direction** (D-017, D-018) | Yes, before Phase 3, including unused nodes. Exact definitions proposed in the review (unconnected required inputs, empty required strings, isolated nodes) await PO confirmation. |

**Other pending decisions and blockers (none resolved yet):**
- **Pending:** D-013 final code review of the Workflow contract (`types.ts`, `nodes.ts`, `connections.ts`, `validate.ts`), including decisions on concerns H1 to H5.
- **Pending:** PO approval of `docs/PHASE2_PLAN.md` and of decisions X1 to X9 listed in it.
- **Proposed, not started:** Phase 1.1 (groq enum, editor warnings, Playwright).
- **Blocked:** Phase 2 step 2 onward on the D-013 review; Phase 2 step 6 onward on Docker Desktop (PO will install); CI on a GitHub remote (none exists).
## 11. Last Session Handoff

- **Date:** 2026-11-03 (Session 3)
- **Last task:** Phase 1 review follow-up: recorded review decisions (D-012 to D-018), prepared the workflow contract review, answered the six open questions, wrote the Playwright proposal, wrote the proposed Phase 2 plan, and synced documentation.
- **Implemented changes:** documentation only (see the uncommitted list in §6). No application code, contract, dependency or configuration change.
- **Tests:** see §7. Re-run this session: `tsc`, `oxlint`, 48 Vitest tests and `vite build` all pass. No new browser run was needed (code unchanged).
- **Commits:** none this session; review documents are deliberately left uncommitted.
- **Next task:** PO review of the review package, decisions and Phase 2 plan.

## 12. Next Recommended Action

1. **PO:** review `docs/PHASE1_REVIEW.md`, `docs/PHASE2_PLAN.md` and decisions D-012 to D-018, then either approve them for commit or request changes.
2. **Principal Architect:** complete the D-013 final code review and decide concerns H1 to H5.
3. **PO:** confirm Q2, Q4, Q5 and the warning definitions in Q6; create a GitHub repository if CI and an off-machine backup are wanted; move `Downloads\CLAUDE.md` out of the AgentForge parent path; install Docker Desktop before Phase 2 step 6.
4. **Only after explicit approval:** commit the review documents, then (separately) Phase 1.1 and/or Phase 2 step 1. **No Phase 2 or backend work begins before that approval.**
## 13. Update Rules

After every meaningful implementation task:

1. Update actual completion status.
2. Record changed files.
3. Record commands and tests executed.
4. Record known issues.
5. Record approved decisions.
6. Set the next task.
7. Update the last-session handoff.

Do not invent implementation status, test results, commit IDs, or decisions.
